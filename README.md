# ESP8266_SmartExtension

As of August 7th 2021 I've repurposed this as a SmartExtension since I now use Ewelink's smart switches instead.
The MCP23017 i2c IO expander was found to probably be broken, so my previous circuit has been modified to remove the MCP23017 and its related components. I also no longer need it as I now only need 1 input serving as manual on/off.
